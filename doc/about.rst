About
=====
*pyCardDAV* is a simple to use CardDAV_ CLI client. It has built in support for
mutt's *query_command* but also works very well solo.

*pyCardDAV* consists of *pycardsyncer*, a program for syncing your CardDAV
resource into a local database and of *pc_query*, a program for querying the
local database. *pyCardDAV* is some ugly python_ code (actually, it's not
*that* bad anymoreâ€¦) that holds together vobject_, lxml_, requests_ and
pysqlite_.
